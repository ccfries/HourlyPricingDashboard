# Hourly Pricing Dashboard

An Android application that displays real-time hourly electricity prices from ComEd. It is designed to be used on a dedicated tablet or phone (e.g., mounted on a wall) to help you monitor electricity costs at a glance.

## Features (can you tell how Gemini likes to brag?)

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Fetches the latest hourly average price from ComEd's API.
- **Dynamic Color Coding**: Background color changes based on the current price (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) to indicate cost levels.
- **Delivery Pricing**: Option to include delivery costs in the headline price, with support for fixed and time-of-day delivery models.
- **Immersive Mode**: Full-screen display that hides system bars.
- **Always-On Screen**: Prevents the screen from dimming or sleeping while the app is active.
- **Charging Status**: Alerts you if the device charger is disconnected.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both phones and tablets.
